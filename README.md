  - Single Player: One user can play against the computer, which employs a simple AI algorithm to make moves.

- Interactive Gameplay:
  - Users can click on the cells to make their moves during the game.
  - The game interface updates in real-time to show the moves made by each player.

- Win and Draw Detection:
  - The game accurately detects when a player wins the game or when the game ends in a draw.
  - Winning combinations are visually highlighted to indicate the winning move.


## Technologies Used

## Future Enhancements

This project can be further improved with the following enhancements:

- Implementing different difficulty levels for the AI in single-player mode.
