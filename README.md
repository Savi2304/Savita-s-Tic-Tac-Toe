# Savita-s-Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game . The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and gameplay.
